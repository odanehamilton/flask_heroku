		<h1>Welcome to Haynes' Law Firm</h1>
		<p>Therefore encourage one another with these words. We do not want you to be uninformed, 
		brothers and sisters, about those who have died, so that you may not grieve as others do who 
		have no hope. For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God 
		will bring with him those who have died. For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that 
		we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will by no means precede those who have died. 
		For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those 
		who have died. For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until 
		the coming of the Lord, will by no means precede those who have died. For the Lord himself, with a cry of 
		command, with the archangel's call and with the sound of God's trumpet, will descend from heaven, and the 
		dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up in the clouds together
